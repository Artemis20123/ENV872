## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the introductory material in Environmental Data Analytics.

## Directions

1.  Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A01_Introduction.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.

## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex

Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.

```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory

This setting will help deal with relative paths later on... - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options` - Select the RMarkdown section - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project"

## 2) Discussion Questions

Enter answers to the questions just below the \>Answer: prompt.

1.  What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have been formally trained with R coding basics in a course one year ago. And I have learnt some data analytics basics by myself to do projects. But I have no experience related to Git. In general, I mainly learnt from the actual coding exercise, which makes my theoretical knowledge of R and data analytics not systematic and comprehensive. For example, I know nothing about the 'environment setting' and how it functions. Thus, I treasure the opportunity to learn those knowledge and Git from this course.

2.  Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I am confident in the data exploration, wrangling, visualization, and modeling modules.

3.  Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am not familiar with the Git part and I hope I can learn from doing in the future.

## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
